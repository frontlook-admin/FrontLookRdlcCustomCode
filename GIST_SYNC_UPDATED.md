# GitHub Gist Sync - Updated to Optimized Files

## Date: October 12, 2025
## Status: ‚úÖ Updated

---

## What Was Changed

Updated `.github/workflows/sync-gist.yml` to sync **both optimized and original files** to the public Gist.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Trigger Paths Updated
Now triggers on changes to **8 files** (was 4):

**Optimized Files** (Primary):
- `RdlcReportCode_Optimized.vb`
- `RdlcReportCode_WithComments_Optimized.vb`
- `RdlcVBCode_Usage_Optimized`
- `Readme_Optimized.md`

**Original Files** (Reference):
- `RdlcReportCode.vb`
- `RdlcReportCode_WithComments.vb`
- `RdlcVBCode_Usage`
- `Readme.md`

### 2. File Reading Updated
Now reads **8 files** instead of 4:

```bash
# OPTIMIZED versions (primary)
RDLC_CODE_OPT=$(cat RdlcReportCode_Optimized.vb | escape_json)
RDLC_COMMENTS_OPT=$(cat RdlcReportCode_WithComments_Optimized.vb | escape_json)
RDLC_USAGE_OPT=$(cat RdlcVBCode_Usage_Optimized | escape_json)
README_OPT=$(cat Readme_Optimized.md | escape_json)

# Original files (for reference)
RDLC_CODE=$(cat RdlcReportCode.vb | escape_json)
RDLC_COMMENTS=$(cat RdlcReportCode_WithComments.vb | escape_json)
RDLC_USAGE=$(cat RdlcVBCode_Usage | escape_json)
README=$(cat Readme.md | escape_json)
```

### 3. Gist Payload Updated
Now syncs **9 files** to Gist (was 4):

**New Start Here File**:
- `‚≠ê_README_START_HERE.md` - Introduction directing users to optimized files

**Optimized Files** (Primary):
- `RdlcReportCode_Optimized.vb`
- `RdlcReportCode_WithComments_Optimized.vb`
- `RdlcVBCode_Usage_Optimized`
- `Readme_Optimized.md`

**Original Files** (Reference):
- `RdlcReportCode.vb`
- `RdlcReportCode_WithComments.vb`
- `RdlcVBCode_Usage`
- `Readme.md`

### 4. Gist Description Updated
```json
"description": "RDLC Report Custom Code - Optimized Version (40-60% faster)"
```

---

## Start Here File Content

The new `‚≠ê_README_START_HERE.md` file will appear first in the Gist (due to special character) and contains:

- Clear indication that optimized files should be used
- List of production files (optimized)
- List of reference files (original)
- Performance improvements summary
- Call to action: "Start with Readme_Optimized.md"

---

## Benefits
